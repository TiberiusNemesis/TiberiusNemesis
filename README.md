 Hi, Iâ€™m @TiberiusNemesis, a computer science student from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I used to be a professional diver! But now, I'm back to CS after an interesting multi-year hiatus. I wasn't trying my best, but a very significant, important event in my life made me realize what path am I supposed to take. Hopefully, it'll be the start of something wonderful and new, not just a dream I can't make true. :)
