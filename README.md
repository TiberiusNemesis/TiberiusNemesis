 Hi, Iâ€™m @TiberiusNemesis, a computer science student from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I used to be a professional diver, then I switched careers over to something I could work with
 stuff I was always good at: programming. Hopefully, it'll be the start of something wonderful and new, not just a dream I can't make true. :)
